IntelliJ VDL plugin
-------------------

# Introduction

The IntelliJ VDL plugin provides [VDL] language support for IDEs based on
IntelliJ, including:

* [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) -- the Java IDE
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)
* RubyMine, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.

# Installation

This section assumes you are using IntelliJ IDEA. The procedure should be
similar for the other IntelliJ-based products as well.

To install the plugin:

* Navigate to the Settings view
* Click "Plugins"
* Click "Browse Repositories"
* In the filter text field, enter "VDL"
* Select "VDL plugin for IntelliJ" from the list
* Click the "Install" button

You will need to restart IDEA for the changes to take effect.
